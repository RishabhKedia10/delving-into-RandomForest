# Understanding the Bias-Variance Trade-off in Random Forest

The strength of Random Forest lies in its ability to balance the bias-variance trade-off, a common challenge in machine learning.

### What is Bias and Variance?

- **Bias**: The error introduced by approximating a real-world problem, which may be too complex, by a simplified model. High bias can cause the model to miss relevant relations between features and target outputs (underfitting).
  
- **Variance**: The error introduced by the modelâ€™s sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training set. High variance can cause the model to model the random noise in the training data (overfitting).

In an ideal scenario, we want a model that has low bias and low variance, but these two metrics are inversely related.

### How Random Forest Helps

Random Forest helps in converting a low bias, high variance model into one with low bias and low variance. By distributing outliers across multiple trees, Random Forest minimizes the impact of outliers on the final prediction.

### Practical Example
