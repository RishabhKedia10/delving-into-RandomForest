# Basic Implementation of Random Forest

This section provides a hands-on approach to implementing a basic Random Forest model. The accompanying notebook demonstrates the core concepts of Random Forest, from training to prediction.

You can access the practical implementation here:

- [Basic Random Forest Implementation](../notebooks/Basic-RandomForest.ipynb)

This notebook will guide you through the process of building a Random Forest model and applying it to a sample dataset.
