# Understanding Feature Importance in Random Forest

Feature importance is a key advantage of tree-based models, including Random Forest, as it provides insights into which features contribute most to the prediction.

### What is Feature Importance?

Feature importance, also known as Gini Importance, is calculated as the (normalized) total reduction of the criterion brought by a feature. It allows you to identify which features have the most influence on the modelâ€™s predictions.

### Why is it Important?

- **Interpretability**: Helps in understanding why the model makes certain predictions.
- **Feature Selection**: Useful in selecting the most important features, especially when dealing with high-dimensional data.
