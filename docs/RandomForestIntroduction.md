# Introduction to Tree-Based Algorithms

Tree-based algorithms are a fundamental part of machine learning, offering a variety of models such as Decision Trees, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest. Among these, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost stand out for their versatility and effectiveness across a wide range of applications.

### Random Forest: An Overview

Random Forest is an ensemble technique that can be applied to both regression and classification problems. It is particularly popular because it doesnâ€™t require extensive hyperparameter tuning to achieve good results, making it a user-friendly choice for many applications.

### How Random Forest Works

Random Forest is essentially a collection of decision trees, built using a method called **bagging** (Bootstrap Aggregating). Bagging involves randomly selecting data samples to train multiple models, and in the case of Random Forest, these models are decision trees.

#### Step 1: Bootstrapping

Random Forest creates each tree using a different random subset of the data, a process known as bootstrapping. There are three main types of sampling in bootstrapping:
- **Row sampling**: Randomly selecting rows from the dataset.
- **Feature (column) sampling**: Randomly selecting features (columns).
- **Combination**: Using both row and feature sampling.

Each tree is trained on a different subset, leading them to behave differently.

#### Step 2: Aggregation

After training, the predictions from all the trees are combined. In classification problems, the final prediction is based on the majority vote from all trees. In regression problems, the mean of all the tree outputs is taken as the final prediction.
